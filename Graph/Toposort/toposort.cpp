/*
    Topological Sorting in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

    Topological sorting is a way to order the nodes (or vertices) in a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
    such that for every directed edge u -> v, node u comes before node v in the ordering.
    Topological sorting is useful in scenarios like dependency resolution, task scheduling, and
    precedence constraints, where certain tasks must be performed before others.

    Key Points:
    - Only DAGs: Topological sorting can only be performed on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
      If the graph contains a cycle, topological sorting is not possible.
    - Multiple Valid Orders: There can be multiple valid topological sorts for a graph,
      depending on the structure of the graph.

    Common Methods to Perform Topological Sort:

    1. DFS-based Topological Sort
       Algorithm:
       - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to visit all nodes.
       - For each node, recursively visit all its unvisited neighbors.
       - After visiting all neighbors, add the node to a result stack or list.
       - Once all nodes are processed, reverse the result to get the topological order.

       Key Points:
       - Nodes are added to the result after all their dependencies (outgoing edges) are processed.
       - Reversing the result gives the correct topological order.

    2. BFS-based Topological Sort (Kahnâ€™s Algorithm)
       Algorithm:
       - Compute the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node.
       - Initialize a queue with all nodes having in-degree 0 (no dependencies).
       - While the queue is not empty:
         - Remove a node from the queue and add it to the result.
         - For each neighbor of the node:
           - Decrease the in-degree of the neighbor by 1.
           - If the in-degree of the neighbor becomes 0, add it to the queue.

       Key Points:
       - Nodes with no incoming edges are processed first.
       - No need to reverse the result, as the order is built correctly.
